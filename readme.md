# KongAir developer portal templates

## Usage
* You can use this template template as a starting point for the Kong V3 developer portal.
    * Light vs dark mode
        * Home page: Use home-light or home-dark depending on the chosen mode. There are different gradients and graphics that work specifically for those modes, but the content itself is the same
        * CSS: use css/styles-light-mode.css or css/styles-dark-mode.css for your preferred mode
        * Logo: 
            * Use images/light-mode/logo.png or uploading the portal logo for light mode portals
            * Use images/dark-mode/logo.png or uploading the portal logo for dark mode portals
    * Documentation & API specs
        * I've created some sample documentation and API specs
            * documentation/ contains the api docs
            * api-specs/ contains open api v3 specs that match the documentation
    * Apis: page that lists the APIs but also has some text to go with the KongAir theme
    * getting-started: another example document that goes along with the KongAir theme
